      <h1>Hello, I'm Krisz ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>I'm a Hungarian software engineering student at <a href="https://pollak.hu" target="_blank">PollÃ¡k Antal Technical School</a>.</p>
      <p>My previous school account <b>was flagged</b>, so all of my repositories are <b>missing</b>. I really want to import them back to here somehow, if that's even possible on GitHub. Yes, I already opened a support ticket, and no, <a href="TicketStatus.md">they didn't answer</a>.</p>
